## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learnt how to center an image on the screen using the css property of margin and setting its value to auto.I also learnt how to use the div component extensively

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me get useful informations of various components of html and css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the workings and attributes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
